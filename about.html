            <p>okay, so, this website is made by me and my name is stan opiol actually but my full name is stanislav okay, so, if you want to contact me go to the contact page
                okay and so basically this website is like for everyone so they can have websites on it they made and its for employers
                its for employers to see who they want actually aswell. i made this website cos what if an employer comes in again and says i want to see some things by students so i can employ them and then carl is like ok here u go and doesnt give him the best students or like all so this website is for the employer ro see the best peoples work and stuff and everyones stuff and so they can chose themselves instead of carl chosing his favourites which is illegal actually he should have made me show the peopel the website cos theyd be well impresed but no</p>
